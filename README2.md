# Further Analysis On Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

For this project, I added two more analyses to the original kickstarter analysis: 

1) Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

2) Outcomes Based on Goals

In the previous analysis, we were able to deduce a correlation based on descriptive statistics, and a box and whisker plot. In this project, I went ahead and took the extra step of creating graphs and a table for this data.

### Purpose

The main reason to conduct these analyses was to provide clear visualization of the relationship
between outcomes, and their individual goals and launch dates. Using this information, I could
better inform Louise and help her understand why certain goals may be more realistic than
others, and also why certain times of the year are better to launch a campaign than others.

## Analysis and Challenges

In our analysis we looked at individual months, and saw how campaigns in the theater category 
faired dependent upon the time of year they were held. We also divided goal ranges in 5000 dollar
increments, and checked what percentage of the campaigns were successful, which failed, and which just got canceled, dependent upon the goal range. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Here graphed are the outcomes of theater campaigns dependent upon the month they were launched. Based on the graph, we can see
the summer months performed much better than the rest of the months for theater. However, failed campaigns did not seem to differ much with the passing of time. Could there perhaps be more to the success and failures than we are currently seeing?

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Here we can see a clear picture of how the outcomes are affected at multiple dollar amounts. We can conlude that campaigns asking for lower amounts seem more likely to be successful than those at higher amounts. However, we do see that some categories
have percent successes that are very similar to the percent successes of the lower dollar amounts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Anytime we visualize correlations between data, we leave out some details unavoidably:

1)  For outcomes based on launch date, we see that certain months do perform better, but that 
does not mean Louise should hold her campaign off. Theater as a category is overall very successful
and has more successes than it does failures.

2) For outcomes based on goals, we narrow down our search to only the dollar amount for every 
campaign, while leaving out the question: are there simply more campaigns that ask for the 1000 
to 5000 dollar range? Sure enough, we can see that some categories which were higher performed
nearly as well in the percent successful category. 

## Results

- Two conclusions about outcomes based on launch date: while you are more likely to be successful
in the summer months, you're also not any less likely to fail, as the failed campaigns remain fairly
even throughout the year. The second conclusion is, if your campaign is in theater, these succeed
overall more.

- One conclusion about the outcomes based on goals: we see that lower asking prices generally
fair better than higher goals. 

- As mentioned above, we cannot possibly see all the factors that make the data move. What was 
the economy like at that time? Where in the US are these campaigns being held, and how do 
other fundraising campaigns fair on different sites?

- Knowing this, we could create a graph that mapped the US according to regions, and see where
these campaigns are truly shining in the US. Also, we could search for large world events that could
impact the availability of funds to provide to kickstarters(in light of the imminent COVID pandemic.)

After all is said and done, we can still extract fairly good evidence from these two graphs to help
Louise organize a successful campaign.
