# Analyzing Kickstarter Campaigns To Help Louise Strategize

This project focused on taking data from thousands of kickstarter campaigns, to help Louise figure out how to best---
plan her own. To do this, we looked at data across several categories such as... ---

*Which campaigns were successful, and which ones failed?
*How did plays in theater fair in the US?
*What was the goal all of these plays had in mind?
*Were certain months better for starting a campaign than others?

After gathering all this data, we had a few main takeaways:

Campaigns in the theater category were significantly more successful in the summer months, ---
than they were any other time of year. We could also gleam that theater overall, held fairly successful---
campaigns. Great news!

On the other hand, Louise's goal of 10,000 dollars may be shooting too high.

Crunching the numbers, we found the average goal of successful US campaigns was closer to 5,000 dollars, ---
while failed campaigns were asking closer to 10,000 dollars. That last number is right where Louise's budget lands at unfortunately.

But there's always hope! Louise, however hard it may be, lowering your goal closer to 5,000 dollars, and shooting ---
to hold your campaign in the summer months will give you the greatest chance of making your play come true!
